# Saving Grace Bible Church Website

Local Phase 3B.2 caption/enrichment rehearsal plus provisional Phase 3B.2b punctuation-workflow hardening for the Astro/TypeScript/PostgreSQL replacement described in `church-website-architecture-plan.md`.

## Current scope

- Fail-closed journalled local PostgreSQL schema runner plus explicit standalone rollback SQL
- Typed public/admin sermon API contracts
- Runtime input validation
- Parameterized PostgreSQL public sermon repository
- Framework-independent `/api/v1/sermons` list/detail HTTP router
- Provider-independent protected admin handlers with allowlisted local test identities
- Final default-deny single-`admin` policy with no editor/contributor or ownership-based behaviour
- Transactional create/update/relationship operations, explicit lifecycle transitions, audit, and row-version concurrency
- Exactly one nullable-while-incomplete speaker relationship; schedule/publish requires one and migration refuses multi-speaker anomalies
- Reused `sermons.summary` as the reviewed public **Sermon description**, with explicit lifecycle/provenance, approved-only weight-C search and controlled `seo_description` fallback
- First-class reviewed plain-text transcripts and 5–10 ordered reviewed Q&A pairs with approved-only lower-weight search
- Derived readiness, exact 453/453 historical launch gate, deterministic enrichment queue, and idempotent draft-only import contract
- Private YouTube Studio caption-file processor with trusted exact-scope derivation, deterministic punctuation-only chunks and hashes, whole-sermon lexical-token preservation/rollback, structured source provenance/warnings, and no media/network implementation
- Legacy query/date compatibility translation
- Deterministic Advanced Sermons dry-run importer
- Loopback-only anonymised fixture loader with an explicit write opt-in
- Date, status, slug, taxonomy, scripture, and media transformations
- Structured migration audit/warning output
- Permanent whole-site SEO non-regression, one-to-one URL mapping, and launch-gate planning
- Responsive accessible six-step local `/admin` workflow with description editor/status/actions/counts, anonymised-data notice, progress, issue filters, checklist, transcript/Q&A editing, slug redirects, and safeguarded deletion dispositions
- Server-rendered uncollapsed approved description before media/transcript/Q&A; collapsed transcript remains in initial markup and list payloads omit heavy bodies
- Automated migration, security, lifecycle, configuration, and schema-contract tests

This milestone does not include deployment, cloud infrastructure, Cognito configuration, production loading, the remaining 450 sermons, external providers, audio/video processing, new transcription, or any WordPress/YouTube mutation. Phase 3B.2b hardens the offline workflow for exactly the two records identified by the committed Phase 3B.2 outcome as requiring manual punctuation; it does not reprocess the already-successful record. The hardened implementation has been exercised only with anonymised fixtures. Real private preparation, finalisation, import, idempotency and verification results remain pending a separate explicitly authorised rerun. The AWS runtime and Astro production adapter remain intentionally undecided.

The disposable PostgreSQL integration is verified only against `savinggrace_sermons_test` on `127.0.0.1:5432`. The schema runner uses a separate `schema_migrations` journal, stable checksums of each paired up/down definition, an advisory lock, exact-prefix validation and transactional DDL/receipt writes. A matching fully applied schema is a no-op; unknown, changed, missing, duplicate, reordered or unjournalled history fails closed instead of being baselined. Disposable database contents are test state, not milestone authority.

The implemented admin routes, authorization, transition, deletion, and dashboard contracts are documented in `admin-api-contract.md`. There is one non-secret local admin identity, disabled by default, limited to loopback/development, and never a substitute for the future verified identity adapter.

## Permanent SEO launch gate

The current website performs well in organic search. The rebuild must preserve its established search signals at minimum across the entire website and should improve technical SEO only when safely validated. Production launch is blocked unless complete URL mapping, metadata/canonical parity, direct redirects, crawlability/indexability, sitemap/robots/structured data, internal-link, mobile/accessibility/performance, pre-launch crawl, and rollback evidence pass the requirements in `seo-migration-validation-plan.md`.

Ranking improvements are not guaranteed. Primary indexable content must be server-rendered and visible without client-side JavaScript; non-public/admin/search/preview/staging routes must remain non-indexable. The known staging-origin social-image defect must be corrected before launch. A fresh production crawl or Search Console/analytics access requires a later explicitly approved read-only task and has not been performed in this local milestone.

## Local commands

```text
npm install
npm run check
npm test
npm run build
npm run migration:dry-run -- --input tests/fixtures/dry-run.json
npm run enrichment:export-queue-local -- anonymised-local-fixture
npm run enrichment:import-draft-local -- path/to/strict-local-draft-bundle.json
npm run enrichment:pilot-local -- path/to/ignored-private-pilot-manifest.json
npm run enrichment:punctuation-local -- prepare path/to/ignored-private-pilot-manifest.json video-id private-workspace
npm run launch-readiness:local
```

The dry-run command accepts an approved local JSON input and prints only the safe migration report. It does not connect to MariaDB or PostgreSQL and never writes records. Original media/embed values remain internal migration provenance and are deliberately omitted from stdout.

The enrichment queue is deterministic by safe source WordPress ID and missing requirement across description, transcript and Q&A. Draft import requires the same loopback/write gate as fixture loading, validates target/source identity and row version, rejects HTML-like content, stores private structured provenance, remains idempotent, never marks content reviewed/approved, and refuses to replace different approved descriptions, transcripts, or Q&A. The private pilot commands read local caption text only and contain no downloader, audio processing, speech-to-text, provider or network implementation. Phase 3B.2b normalises source and cleaned text to Unicode NFC, measures whitespace-delimited lexical-token sequences independently, strips only Unicode punctuation from each token for comparison, and case-folds the remainder. It rejects any token count, boundary, order or content change—including splitting or merging—while allowing punctuation, case and line-break changes. Stable chunks, cryptographic hashes, deterministic reassembly, exact-two trusted scope, no-clobber persistence and fail-closed verification are provisional until the real private pilot is separately authorised and rerun.

When a disposable loopback PostgreSQL database is available, apply the schema and load the anonymised fixture only with both `DATABASE_URL` and `ALLOW_LOCAL_DB_WRITE=1`:

```text
npm run db:apply-local
npm run migration:load-local -- --input tests/fixtures/dry-run.json
npm run api:local
npm run db:rollback-local
```

The schema commands keep schema history separate from `migration_records` and `sermon_enrichment_draft_imports`. Apply runs only the pending canonical suffix. Rollback removes only the latest requested receipt, or the full applied suffix for an unscoped rollback, in the same transaction as its down SQL. The SQL files remain independently executable rollback artifacts; the runner normalises CRLF/CR/LF differences before hashing their paired definitions.

After `npm run build`, the reviewed Phase 3B dashboard can be started with the existing password-free libpq credential mechanism:

```powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/savinggrace_sermons_test"
$env:ALLOW_LOCAL_DB_WRITE="1"
npm run dashboard:local
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4322/admin`. The harness refuses non-loopback database and listener targets. Stop it with `Ctrl+C` after local review.

The loader and integration suite refuse every target except `savinggrace_sermons_test` on loopback port 5432. Real PostgreSQL integration tests additionally require `TEST_DATABASE_URL` and `RUN_POSTGRES_INTEGRATION=1`.

## Project boundaries

- `src/domain`: framework-independent types and deterministic transformations
- `src/api/contracts`: stable `/api/v1` public/admin validation contracts
- `src/application`: lifecycle and permission rules
- `src/server/auth`: provider-independent identity boundary and local-only allowlisted adapter
- `src/server`: server-only PostgreSQL repository, query, and portable HTTP boundaries
- `src/migration`: journalled schema runner, importer, audit output, identity, and CLI
- `src/enrichment`: strict queue/draft contracts, provider interfaces, and local idempotent PostgreSQL draft workflow
- `src/readiness`: derived exact-count historical launch gate and safe CLI report
- `historical-enrichment-plan.md`: three-output Phase 3B.2 contract, review boundary and exact launch gate
- `db/migrations`: ordered PostgreSQL SQL migrations
- `tests`: anonymised fixtures and automated contract tests

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to a local ignored `.env` only when a local PostgreSQL service is available. Never place legacy or production credentials in repository files. A production Astro/AWS adapter has not been selected; `api:local` is a local-only Node harness around the portable request handlers.

## Source safety

The proprietary `advanced-sermons*.zip` pattern and extracted plugin directories are excluded by `.gitignore`. Plugin implementation code must never be copied into this application. The exact installed source was inspected read-only outside the workspace and is identified only by aggregate fingerprints in the discovery artifacts.

## Next approval gate

Phase 3C remains paused and the remaining 450 sermons are not authorised. First, separately authorise and run the real private Phase 3B.2b workflow, review its bounded report, and obtain administrator review of every draft and retained uncertainty. Before any larger Phase 3B.2 batch, the church must explicitly accept the verified three-record pilot report, nominate administrator reviewers/approvers, confirm real source identities/service dates, approve the next exact allowlist and batch size, and reconfirm workload, privacy/retention, retry, correction, audit, rollback and human-approval rules. Launch remains blocked until all 453 records are complete and separately approved and the whole-site SEO gate passes.
